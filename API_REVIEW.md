# Business Logic API Review

## 1. Executive Summary

The Business Logic API has a solid foundation, with a good separation of concerns into `routers`, `services`, and a `domain` layer (though the domain layer is not fully utilized in all routers). The use of FastAPI is consistent, and authentication mechanisms are in place.

The most significant areas for improvement are:

1.  **Inconsistent API Versioning and Structure**: Not all API endpoints are versioned under `/api/v1`, and some routers (`influencer`, `users`) exist outside the four primary categories (`operations`, `workflows`,- `integrations`, `admin`) defined in the guide.
2.  **Inconsistent Schema Usage**: Many endpoints are missing Pydantic `response_model` definitions, which weakens the API contract and can lead to inconsistent responses.
3.  **Incomplete Implementations**: Some endpoints are stubs with `TODO` comments.

## 2. Router-by-Router Analysis

### 2.1. Admin Router (`/api/v1/admin`)

*   **[PASS]** Prefix & Authentication: Correctly implemented.
*   **[FAIL]** Schemas: Lacks `response_model` definitions for all endpoints.
*   **[WARN]** Implementation: The `list_access_requests` endpoint is a placeholder.

**Recommendation**:
*   Add Pydantic response models for all endpoints to ensure a consistent API contract.
*   Complete the implementation of `list_access_requests`.

### 2.2. Auth Router (`/api/auth`)

*   **[WARN]** Prefix: Unversioned prefix (`/api/auth`) is inconsistent with other business logic APIs. While potentially deliberate for OAuth stability, it should be a conscious design decision.
*   **[WARN]** Service Layer: Logic is tightly coupled to the router.
*   **[FAIL]** Schemas: Lacks `response_model` definitions.

**Recommendation**:
*   Consider moving the auth logic to a versioned endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth`) for consistency, unless there's a strong reason not to.
*   Refactor the Strapi communication logic into an `AuthService` to improve separation of concerns.
*   Define response models for `/token` and `/me` endpoints.

### 2.3. Health Router (`/status/health`)

*   **[PASS]** This router is simple and well-implemented. No changes are recommended.

### 2.4. Influencer Router (`/api/v1/influencer`)

*   **[WARN]** Structure: The existence of a separate `influencer` router deviates from the guide's four categories.
*   **[FAIL]** Schemas: Lacks request and response models.

**Recommendation**:
*   **Option A (Preferred)**: Consolidate these endpoints into the `operations` router (e.g., `/api/v1/operations/influencer/referral-links`). This aligns with the guide's structure.
*   **Option B**: If keeping a separate router, ensure it's a deliberate design choice and update the API documentation to reflect this.
*   Implement Pydantic models for all request bodies and response models.

### 2.5. Integrations Router (`/api/v1/integrations`)

*   **[PASS]** This router is the best example of the guide's principles in action. It uses API key auth, a service layer, and schemas correctly.

**Recommendation**:
*   Use this router as a template for how other routers should be implemented.

### 2.6. Operations Router (`/api/v1/operations`)

*   **[WARN]** Schemas: Inconsistent use of `response_model`. Some endpoints have it, others return raw dictionaries.

**Recommendation**:
*   Ensure every endpoint in this router has a `response_model` defined.

### 2.7. Users Router (`/api/users`)

*   **[WARN]** Prefix: Unversioned prefix (`/api`) is inconsistent.
*   **[WARN]** Structure: A separate `users` router is outside the guide's four categories.

**Recommendation**:
*   Move these endpoints into the `operations` router (e.g., `/api/v1/operations/users/me/settings`).
*   Update the prefix to be versioned (`/api/v1`).

## 3. Overall Recommendations

1.  **Enforce Schema Usage**: Mandate that every endpoint has a `response_model` and that any request body is defined by a Pydantic model. This is the most critical improvement for API stability and clarity.
2.  **Standardize API Structure**: Decide on a consistent structure. Either strictly adhere to the four routers defined in the guide (`operations`, `workflows`, `integrations`, `admin`) or formally update the guide to include the new routers (`influencer`, `users`). Consolidating into the main four is recommended for simplicity.
3.  **Standardize API Versioning**: All business logic endpoints should be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`). The `auth` and `users` routers should be updated to follow this pattern.
4.  **Complete Implementation**: Finish the implementation of all placeholder endpoints.

By addressing these points, the Business Logic API will be more robust, maintainable, and consistent with the architectural vision.
