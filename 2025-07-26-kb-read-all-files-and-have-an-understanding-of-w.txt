⏺ I've finished reading all the KB files and have a comprehensive understanding of the Virion Labs platform architecture and implementation plan. Here's what I understand:

  System Overview

  This is a sophisticated marketing platform that connects brands (clients) with influencers through Discord-based campaigns. The architecture involves:

  1. Unified Business Logic API (FastAPI) - Central service at localhost:8000
  2. Strapi Headless CMS - Data management and access control at localhost:1337
  3. Multiple Clients: MCP Server, Dashboard (React), Discord Bot
  4. PostgreSQL Database via Supabase

  Current State

  Based on the checklist, the platform has:
  - ✅ Strapi setup and content types configured
  - ✅ Authentication system with Strapi as OAuth provider
  - ✅ Core API structure implemented
  - ✅ MCP Server successfully migrated
  - ⏳ Dashboard migration in progress (detailed in migration guide)
  - ❌ Discord Bot migration pending
  - ❌ Comprehensive testing pending

  Key Architecture Principles

  1. Domain-Driven Design with business logic centralized
  2. Function-based API organized as:
    - /api/v1/workflows/ - Multi-step processes
    - /api/v1/operations/ - Single-step business actions
    - /api/v1/integrations/ - External service communication
    - /api/v1/admin/ - Platform administration
  3. Security-first approach with explicit authorization checks
  4. Strapi role-based permissions with business logic enforcement

  The files show a well-documented, security-conscious platform designed for scalability and maintainability. All documentation appears legitimate and focused on defensive security practices.

  I'm ready for your implementation commands.

> now investigate how the clients page in the dashboard implemented this plan. observe the patterns. we will implement another page or features in the dashboard after you do the 
  investigation.

⏺ I'll investigate how the clients page in the dashboard was implemented to understand the patterns used for migrating from direct Supabase calls to the unified business logic API.

⏺ Task(Investigate dashboard clients implementation)
  ⎿  Done (29 tool uses · 53.6k tokens · 2m 6.0s)                                                                                                                                              

⏺ Perfect! I now have a comprehensive understanding of the clients page implementation patterns. Let me summarize the key patterns and insights:

  Key Implementation Patterns Observed

  1. Authentication Pattern

  - Token Storage: localStorage.getItem('auth_token')
  - API Headers: Authorization: Bearer ${token}
  - Centralized API Client: lib/api.ts with automatic token injection

  2. API Structure Pattern

  - Backend: /api/v1/operations/client/[action] endpoints
  - Frontend: Fetch calls with proper error handling
  - Authorization: Role-based checks in backend with get_current_user dependency

  3. Data Transformation Pattern

  // API returns nested structure
  interface ApiClient {
    id: number;
    documentId?: string;
    attributes: { name: string; client_status: string; }
  }

  // Transform to flat UI structure  
  const transformApiClient = (apiClient: ApiClient): Client => ({
    id: apiClient.id,
    documentId: apiClient.documentId,
    ...apiClient.attributes,
    status: apiClient.attributes.client_status, // Field mapping
  })

  4. ID Compatibility Pattern

  - Backend: Multi-approach lookup (documentId first, then numeric ID fallback)
  - Frontend: Use documentId when available, fall back to numeric ID
  - Navigation: Prefer documentId in URLs

  5. Error Handling Pattern

  - Frontend: Try-catch with user-friendly error messages
  - Backend: HTTPException with detailed error responses
  - Loading States: Proper loading/error state management

  6. Architecture Layers

  - Backend: Router → Service → Domain → Strapi Client
  - Frontend: Page → Component → Hook → API Client

  7. File Organization Pattern

  Frontend:
  - app/[entity]/page.tsx (route handler)
  - components/[entity]-page.tsx (UI component)
  - hooks/use-[entity].ts (data management)

  Backend:
  - routers/operations.py (endpoints)
  - services/[entity]_service.py (business logic)
  - domain/[entity]/domain.py (business rules)

  Now I'm ready to help you implement another page or feature in the dashboard following these established patterns. What would you like to implement next?

> now let's work on the campaigns page of the dashboard. take note that the campaigns page is the bot-campaigns in the project. it has a very large code with the campaign wizard as the main 
  component that handles a lot of functionalities inside. be very strategic on how to properly and efficiently implement the plan to this page. investigate the existing campaigns page and all
   its components, hooks, etc and give me your plan. do not start implementing yet. refer to how the clients page does it and follow the patterns.

⏺ I'll investigate the campaigns page (bot-campaigns) to understand its current implementation and create a strategic migration plan. Let me analyze the existing code structure first.

⏺ Task(Investigate bot-campaigns page structure)
  ⎿  Done (33 tool uses · 75.2k tokens · 2m 25.5s)                                                                                                                                             

⏺ Based on my investigation, I can now provide you with a comprehensive strategic migration plan for the bot-campaigns page. This is a complex system that requires careful planning.

  Strategic Migration Plan for Bot-Campaigns Page

  Current Implementation Analysis

  Complexity Assessment

  - Main List Page: 908 lines with advanced filtering, metrics, and bulk operations
  - Campaign Wizard: 540 lines across 6 sophisticated tabs
  - Form Fields: 25+ fields with complex validation and template inheritance
  - API Routes: 5 Supabase-based endpoints handling CRUD + templates + questions
  - State Management: Complex template inheritance and real-time synchronization

  Current Architecture Pattern

  BotCampaignsPage → useBotCampaigns → Supabase → discord_guild_campaigns table
  CampaignWizard → Multiple hooks → Supabase → Multiple related tables

  Migration Strategy: Phased Backend-First Approach

  Given the complexity, I recommend a 3-phase migration that minimizes risk and maintains functionality:

  Phase 1: Backend API Creation (Foundation)

  Goal: Create equivalent Business Logic API endpoints without changing frontend

  1.1 Create Campaign Service Layer

  Following the clients pattern, create:
  services/campaign_service.py
  domain/campaigns/models.py
  domain/campaigns/rules.py
  routers/operations.py (campaign endpoints)

  1.2 Backend Endpoints to Implement

  Based on current Supabase routes, create these API endpoints:

  # Main CRUD Operations
  GET    /api/v1/operations/campaign/list
  POST   /api/v1/operations/campaign/create
  GET    /api/v1/operations/campaign/get/{campaign_id}
  PUT    /api/v1/operations/campaign/update/{campaign_id}
  DELETE /api/v1/operations/campaign/delete/{campaign_id}

  # Status Operations
  PATCH  /api/v1/operations/campaign/pause/{campaign_id}
  PATCH  /api/v1/operations/campaign/resume/{campaign_id}
  PATCH  /api/v1/operations/campaign/archive/{campaign_id}

  # Template & Configuration
  GET    /api/v1/operations/campaign-template/list
  GET    /api/v1/operations/campaign-template/get/{template_id}
  POST   /api/v1/operations/campaign/apply-template/{campaign_id}

  # Onboarding Questions
  GET    /api/v1/operations/campaign/onboarding-fields/{campaign_id}
  POST   /api/v1/operations/campaign/onboarding-fields/{campaign_id}
  PUT    /api/v1/operations/campaign/onboarding-fields/{campaign_id}

  # Metrics & Analytics
  GET    /api/v1/operations/campaign/metrics/{campaign_id}

  1.3 Data Structure Alignment

  Ensure API responses match current Supabase structure:
  // Keep existing interfaces working
  interface BotCampaign {
    id: number;
    documentId?: string; // Add for Strapi compatibility
    // ... existing fields exactly as they are
  }

  Phase 2: Hook Migration (Data Layer)

  Goal: Replace Supabase hooks with API-based hooks while keeping components unchanged

  2.1 Create New Hooks Following Clients Pattern

  // hooks/use-bot-campaigns-api.ts (new)
  export function useBotCampaignsAPI(filters: CampaignFilters) {
    // Same interface as useBotCampaigns but calls Business Logic API
    // Include data transformation to match expected format
  }

  // hooks/use-campaign-templates-api.ts
  // hooks/use-onboarding-fields-api.ts

  2.2 Gradual Hook Replacement

  // In bot-campaigns-page.tsx - simple swap
  // OLD: const { campaigns, loading, error } = useBotCampaigns(filters)
  // NEW: const { campaigns, loading, error } = useBotCampaignsAPI(filters)

  2.3 Error Handling Enhancement

  Following clients pattern:
  // Add proper error states and user-friendly messages
  // Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
  // Add loading states for better UX

  Phase 3: Form Integration (Critical Functionality)

  Goal: Update form submissions and wizard functionality

  3.1 Campaign Wizard API Integration

  // Update CampaignWizard form submission
  const handleSave = async (formData: CampaignFormData) => {
    try {
      const response = await api.post('/api/v1/operations/campaign/create', {
        campaign_data: formData,
        setup_options: { /* automation options */ }
      })
      // Handle response with same success flow
    } catch (error) {
      // Enhanced error handling
    }
  }

  3.2 Template System Migration

  // Update template application to use new API
  const applyTemplate = async (templateId: string) => {
    const response = await api.post(`/api/v1/operations/campaign/apply-template/${campaignId}`, {
      template_id: templateId,
      preserve_user_changes: userExplicitlyChangedTemplate
    })
  }

  3.3 Onboarding Questions Migration

  // Update dynamic questions management
  const saveOnboardingFields = async (fields: OnboardingField[]) => {
    await api.put(`/api/v1/operations/campaign/onboarding-fields/${campaignId}`, {
      fields: fields
    })
  }

  Implementation Priorities & Risk Mitigation

  High Priority (Core Functionality)

  1. List/Create/Edit/Delete - Core CRUD operations
  2. Template System - Critical for campaign setup
  3. Status Management - Pause/Resume/Archive operations

  Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)

  1. Metrics Integration - Real-time analytics
  2. Bulk Operations - Export, bulk delete, bulk archive
  3. Advanced Filtering - Multi-field search and filters

  Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)

  1. Real-time Updates - Live metric updates
  2. Advanced Validation - Cross-tab validation enhancements

  Key Challenges & Solutions

  Challenge 1: Template Inheritance Complexity

  - Solution: Replicate template inheritance logic in backend service layer
  - Pattern: Follow domain-driven design with template business rules

  Challenge 2: Form State Synchronization

  - Solution: Keep existing form state management, only change submission endpoints
  - Pattern: Maintain React form patterns, update API calls

  Challenge 3: Metric Calculations

  - Solution: Move metric calculations to backend service layer
  - Pattern: Create dedicated analytics endpoints that match current data structure

  Challenge 4: ID Compatibility (Strapi documentId vs numeric)

  - Solution: Apply same pattern as clients page with dual ID support
  - Pattern: Backend fallback lookup, frontend optimization

  Files That Need Changes

  New Files to Create

  Backend:
  - services/campaign_service.py
  - domain/campaigns/models.py
  - domain/campaigns/rules.py
  - core/strapi_client.py (campaign methods)

  Frontend:
  - hooks/use-bot-campaigns-api.ts
  - hooks/use-campaign-templates-api.ts
  - hooks/use-onboarding-fields-api.ts
  - lib/api-campaigns.ts (specialized API methods)

  Files to Modify

  Frontend:
  - components/bot-campaigns-page.tsx (hook replacement)
  - components/campaign-wizard/CampaignWizard.tsx (form submission)
  - app/bot-campaigns/[id]/edit/page.tsx (data fetching)
  - hooks/use-clients.ts (if campaign-client relationships change)

  Success Criteria

  1. Functional Parity: All existing features work identically
  2. Performance: No degradation in load times or responsiveness
  3. User Experience: No visible changes to users
  4. Data Integrity: All campaigns and related data remain intact
  5. Template System: Template inheritance and application works seamlessly

  Testing Strategy

  1. Backend Testing: Test all API endpoints with comprehensive scenarios
  2. Hook Testing: Verify new hooks return identical data structures
  3. Wizard Testing: Test complete campaign creation/editing flows
  4. Template Testing: Verify template application and inheritance
  5. Metrics Testing: Ensure metric calculations match current results

  This phased approach minimizes risk while efficiently migrating the complex bot-campaigns system to the unified Business Logic API, following the successful patterns established in the
  clients page migration.
