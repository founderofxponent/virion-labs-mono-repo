# Referral Link Success Modal Campaign Context Fix

## Issue
When creating a referral link from the links page with a campaign selected, the success modal was not showing the campaign context card (blue gradient section with campaign name and client name), unlike when creating from the campaigns page.

## Root Cause
The `addLink` function in `useReferralLinks` hook was only doing a basic `select()` without the campaign join, so the returned data didn't include campaign information. However, the `fetchLinks` function did include the campaign join.

## Solution

### 1. Updated `addLink` function in `hooks/use-referral-links.ts`
- Modified the Supabase query to include the same campaign join as `fetchLinks`:
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  campaign:discord_guild_campaigns!referral_links_campaign_id_fkey(
    id,
    campaign_name,
    campaign_type,
    client:clients(name)
  )
`)
```

- Added campaign context processing to the returned data:
```typescript
campaign_context: data.campaign ? {
  campaign_id: data.campaign.id,
  campaign_name: data.campaign.campaign_name,
  campaign_type: data.campaign.campaign_type,
  client_name: data.campaign.client?.name || 'Unknown Client'
} : null,
```

### 2. Updated Links Page Modal Props
Modified `components/links-page.tsx` to pass campaign information to the success modal:
```typescript
<ReferralLinkSuccessModal
  // ... other props
  campaignName={createdLink?.campaign_context?.campaign_name}
  clientName={createdLink?.campaign_context?.client_name}
  // ... rest
/>
```

## Result
Now when creating a referral link from the links page with a campaign selected:
1. The `addLink` function returns complete campaign information
2. The success modal receives `campaignName` and `clientName` props
3. The modal displays the blue campaign context card identical to the campaigns page
4. Both pages have consistent UX behavior

## Technical Notes
- TypeScript types were already correctly defined with `campaign_context` in `ReferralLinkWithAnalytics`
- The fix ensures data consistency between creation and listing operations
- All builds pass successfully with no errors
- The solution maintains backwards compatibility (works fine when no campaign is selected)

## UX Consistency Achieved
✅ **Campaigns page**: Shows campaign context when creating from a specific campaign  
✅ **Links page**: Shows campaign context when a campaign is selected in the dropdown  
✅ **Links page**: Shows no campaign context when "Independent Link" is selected  

The modal now intelligently displays campaign information based on actual data rather than page context.
