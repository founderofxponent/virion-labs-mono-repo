# Bot Configuration Edit Error Fix

## Problem

When attempting to edit bot configurations, users encountered a PostgreSQL error:

```
{
    "code": "42601",
    "details": null,
    "hint": "If you want to discard the results of a SELECT, use PERFORM instead.",
    "message": "query has no destination for result data"
}
```

## Root Cause

The error was caused by improper SQL syntax in the `trigger_update_bot_stats()` database function. The function was using:

```sql
SELECT update_virion_bot_stats();
```

In PostgreSQL triggers, when you want to call a function but don't need the result, you should use `PERFORM` instead of `SELECT`.

## Solution

Updated the `trigger_update_bot_stats()` function to use proper syntax:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION trigger_update_bot_stats()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM update_virion_bot_stats();  -- Changed from SELECT to PERFORM
  RETURN COALESCE(NEW, OLD);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## What This Function Does

The `trigger_update_bot_stats()` function:
1. Automatically fires when bot configurations are INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
2. Calls `update_virion_bot_stats()` to refresh statistics
3. Updates the `virion_bot_instances` table with current counts:
   - `total_configurations`: Count of active configurations
   - `total_guilds`: Count of unique Discord servers with configurations

## Testing

✅ **Verified the fix works:**
- Bot configuration updates now execute successfully
- Database triggers fire correctly
- Bot statistics are properly updated
- No more SQL syntax errors

## Impact

This fix resolves the configuration editing functionality, allowing users to:
- ✅ Edit bot configurations without errors
- ✅ See real-time updates in the dashboard
- ✅ Have bot statistics automatically maintained
- ✅ Experience proper error handling and user feedback

The adaptive bot system editing functionality is now fully operational.
