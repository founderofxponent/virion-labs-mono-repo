# Referral Link Campaign Status Integration

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

## üéØ **Overview**

This document outlines the comprehensive integration between campaign status changes and referral link management, ensuring that influencer referral links are automatically synchronized with their associated campaign statuses while preserving all analytics data and providing clear business logic for different scenarios.

---

## üîÑ **Campaign Status Impact on Referral Links**

### **Status Change Matrix**

| Campaign Status | Referral Link Action | Expiration Handling | Count Preservation | Business Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Active** | `is_active = true` | Respect existing expiration | ‚úÖ All counts preserved | Normal operation |
| **Paused** | `is_active = false` | Preserve expiration dates | ‚úÖ All counts preserved | Temporary halt - easy to resume |
| **Archived** | `is_active = false` | Preserve expiration dates | ‚úÖ All counts preserved | Campaign completed - data for reporting |
| **Deleted** | `is_active = false` | Preserve expiration dates | ‚úÖ All counts preserved | Soft delete - audit trail maintained |
| **Restored** | `is_active = true` (if not expired) | Only enable non-expired links | ‚úÖ All counts preserved | Reactivation with expiration validation |

---

## üíº **Ideal Use Cases**

### **1. Campaign Pausing** 
**Scenario**: Temporary campaign suspension (budget exhausted, content review, etc.)

**Referral Link Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ All referral links are immediately disabled
- ‚úÖ All click/conversion counts preserved
- ‚úÖ Expiration dates unchanged
- ‚úÖ Links can be reactivated when campaign resumes

**Business Impact**:
- Influencers cannot generate new referrals during pause
- Existing analytics remain intact for reporting
- Easy to resume campaign without data loss

### **2. Campaign Archiving**
**Scenario**: Campaign has ended successfully or reached its conclusion

**Referral Link Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ All referral links are permanently disabled
- ‚úÖ All historical data preserved for reporting
- ‚úÖ Links show as "Campaign Archived" in influencer dashboard
- ‚úÖ Analytics data available for ROI analysis

**Business Impact**:
- Clean separation between active and completed campaigns
- Complete audit trail for campaign performance
- Influencers can see historical performance but cannot create new referrals

### **3. Campaign Deletion**
**Scenario**: Campaign needs to be removed (compliance, legal, etc.)

**Referral Link Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ All referral links disabled immediately
- ‚úÖ All count data preserved (soft delete approach)
- ‚úÖ Links marked with deletion metadata
- ‚úÖ Audit trail maintained for compliance

**Business Impact**:
- Immediate halt of all referral activity
- Data preserved for legal/audit requirements
- Clear indication of deletion reason in logs

### **4. Campaign Restoration**
**Scenario**: Previously paused/archived campaign is reactivated

**Referral Link Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Only non-expired links are reactivated
- ‚úÖ Expired links remain disabled (business logic)
- ‚úÖ All historical counts preserved
- ‚úÖ Metadata updated with restoration timestamp

**Business Impact**:
- Smart reactivation prevents expired link usage
- Maintains data integrity
- Clear audit trail of status changes

## üìä **Count and Analytics Data Handling**

### **Data Preservation Principle**
**All campaign status changes preserve analytics data completely:**

- **Click Counts**: Never modified or reset
- **Conversion Counts**: Always preserved
- **Earnings Data**: Maintained for reporting
- **Conversion Rates**: Calculated from preserved data
- **Analytics Events**: Historical data preserved

### **Metadata Tracking**
Each status change is logged in the referral link's metadata:

```json
{
  "last_campaign_status_change": {
    "action": "pause",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "previous_active_status": true,
    "reason": "campaign_paused"
  }
}
```

### **Performance Metrics Impact**

| Metric | Status Change Impact | Reporting Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Total Clicks** | No change | Always shows cumulative data |
| **Total Conversions** | No change | Always shows cumulative data |
| **Conversion Rate** | Calculated from preserved data | Reflects true historical performance |
| **Earnings** | No change | Preserved for influencer payments |
| **Recent Activity** | New activity stops | Historical data available |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Function**
```sql
sync_referral_links_with_campaign_status(
  p_campaign_id UUID,
  p_campaign_action TEXT,
  p_campaign_is_active BOOLEAN,
  p_campaign_is_deleted BOOLEAN,
  p_campaign_paused_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  p_campaign_end_date TIMESTAMPTZ
)
```

### **Automatic Triggers**
The system automatically calls the sync function when:
- Campaign is paused via PATCH `/api/bot-campaigns/[id]` with `action: 'pause'`
- Campaign is resumed via PATCH `/api/bot-campaigns/[id]` with `action: 'resume'`
- Campaign is archived via PATCH `/api/bot-campaigns/[id]` with `action: 'archive'`
- Campaign is deleted via DELETE `/api/bot-campaigns/[id]`
- Campaign is restored via PATCH `/api/bot-campaigns/[id]` with `action: 'restore'`

### **Error Handling**
- Referral link sync failures don't prevent campaign status changes
- Warning logs generated for failed syncs
- Graceful degradation maintains system stability

## üéØ **Business Rules**

### **Expiration Logic**
1. **During Activation**: Only non-expired links are enabled
2. **During Deactivation**: All links disabled regardless of expiration
3. **Expiration Dates**: Never modified by status changes
4. **Manual Override**: Admins can manually enable expired links if needed

### **Status Precedence**
1. **Link Expiration**: Overrides campaign activation (expired links stay disabled)
2. **Campaign Status**: Controls active link behavior
3. **Manual Overrides**: Admin actions can override automatic status

### **Audit Requirements**
- All status changes logged with timestamps
- Reason codes tracked for compliance
- User actions logged for accountability
- Data retention follows company policies

## üìà **Reporting and Analytics**

### **Dashboard Impact**
- **Influencer Dashboard**: Shows current link status with campaign context
- **Admin Dashboard**: Displays campaign-wide referral link health
- **Analytics Reports**: Historical data always available

### **Key Metrics Tracking**
```sql
-- Get campaign referral link summary
SELECT * FROM get_campaign_referral_link_summary('campaign-uuid');
```

Returns:
- Total links count
- Active vs inactive links
- Expired links count
- Aggregate click/conversion data

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Track sync function execution time
- Monitor referral link update success rates
- Alert on sync failures
- Dashboard widgets for campaign health

---

## üîç **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

### **Health Checks**
```sql
-- Check for desynchronized links
SELECT rl.id, rl.title, rl.is_active, dgc.is_active as campaign_active
FROM referral_links rl
JOIN discord_guild_campaigns dgc ON rl.campaign_id = dgc.id
WHERE rl.is_active != dgc.is_active
AND dgc.is_deleted = false
AND (rl.expires_at IS NULL OR rl.expires_at > NOW());
```

### **Common Issues**
1. **Sync Function Failures**: Check database logs for errors
2. **Expired Link Reactivation**: Verify expiration date logic
3. **Count Discrepancies**: Ensure no data modification occurred

### **Resolution Steps**
1. Manually call sync function for affected campaign
2. Verify database function permissions
3. Check for foreign key constraint issues
4. Review error logs for root cause analysis
