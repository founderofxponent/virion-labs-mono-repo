# Checklist: Unified API Implementation & Platform Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-07-26

**Author:** Gemini

## 1. Objective

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for the entire platform refactoring effort as outlined in the `KB/api_and_architecture_docs`. It tracks our progress against the original vision of creating a decoupled architecture with a **Unified Business Logic API** and a **Strapi Headless CMS**.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

*As per `01_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PLAN.md`*

| Task | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strapi Project Setup** | Strapi project is set up and connected to the Supabase PostgreSQL database. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| **Business Logic API Package** | The `/packages/virion-labs-business-logic-api/` package has been created. | ‚úÖ **Done** |

---

## Phase 2: Data Modeling & Access Control in Strapi

*As per `01_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PLAN.md`*

| Task | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Content-Types** | All database tables re-created as Strapi Content-Types. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| **Roles & Permissions** | User roles (`Admin`, `Client`, etc.) and their permissions are configured in Strapi. | ‚úÖ **Done** |

---

## Phase 3: Build the Unified Business Logic API

*As per `01_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PLAN.md` and `02_UNIFIED_API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`*

| Task | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core API Structure** | Implemented the core API structure with a domain-driven design (`core`, `routers`, `services`, etc.). | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| **Authentication** | Implemented a robust, centralized authentication system. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **Strapi as Auth Server** | Strapi is successfully configured as the OAuth 2.0 provider. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **API as Auth Gateway** | The API correctly proxies authentication requests to Strapi. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **Client Compliance** | The API is fully compliant with the security and protocol requirements of the MCP clients (PKCE, state, etc.). | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| **Build Endpoints** | Build out the full suite of endpoints as defined in the implementation blueprint. | ‚è≥ **In Progress** |
| ‚Ü≥ **`/api/v1/operations/`** | The `operations` router is created and included in the app. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **`/api/v1/workflows/`** | The `workflows` router is created and included in the app. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **`/api/v1/integrations/`** | The `integrations` router is created and included in the app. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **`/api/v1/admin/`** | The `admin` router is created and included in the app. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| **Write Tests** | Write comprehensive tests for the new API. | ‚ùå **To Do** |

---

## Phase 4: Client Migration

*As per `01_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PLAN.md` and `04_MCP_SERVER_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`*

| Task | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MCP Server Migration** | Update the MCP server to use the new Unified API. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **Authentication** | MCP Server successfully authenticates through the new API. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **Function Discovery** | MCP Server can successfully discover and list functions from the new API's OpenAPI schema. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| ‚Ü≥ **Function Execution** | MCP Server can successfully execute functions on the new API. | ‚úÖ **Done** |
| **Dashboard Migration** | Plan and execute the migration of the Dashboard to use the new Unified API. | ‚ùå **To Do** |
| **Discord Bot Migration** | Plan and execute the migration of the Discord Bot to use the new Unified API. | ‚ùå **To Do** |

---

## 5. Conclusion

The foundational work of the platform refactoring is a major success. The new architecture is in place, the core services are communicating correctly, and the authentication system has been completely modernized. The first client, the `mcp-server`, has been fully migrated, proving the viability and success of the new design.

The project can now move forward with confidence to implement the remaining business logic endpoints and migrate the remaining clients (Dashboard and Discord Bot).
