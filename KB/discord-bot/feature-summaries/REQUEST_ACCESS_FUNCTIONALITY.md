# Request Access to Private Channels - Discord Bot Feature

## Overview

The Discord bot now includes a **Request Access** functionality that allows users to request access to private channels through a verified role system. This feature is designed with environment variables for easy per-client deployment configuration.

## How It Works

### User Flow (Automatic Approval)
1. **User runs `/request-access`** in the designated request channel
2. **Bot presents an interface** with request details and "Complete Access Form" button
3. **User clicks "Complete Access Form"** to open a modal with Name and Email fields
4. **User fills out the form** with their full name and email address
5. **Bot automatically validates** the form data and assigns the verified role
6. **User receives immediate confirmation** and gains access to private channels

### No Manual Approval Required
- ✅ **Automatic processing** - No moderator intervention needed
- ✅ **Instant access** - Users get verified role immediately upon form submission
- ✅ **Self-service** - Streamlined process without manual review steps

## Environment Variables Configuration

### Required Variables
```bash
# Request Access Configuration
DISCORD_REQUEST_ACCESS_CHANNEL_ID=your_request_access_channel_id_here
DISCORD_VERIFIED_ROLE_ID=your_verified_role_id_here
```

### Optional Variables (existing)
```bash
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_primary_discord_server_id_here
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Discord Server Setup
1. **Create a request-access channel** (e.g., #request-access)
2. **Create a verified role** (e.g., "Verified" or "Member")
3. **Set up private channels** with role permissions for the verified role
4. **Get the channel and role IDs** from Discord

### 2. Environment Configuration
1. **Copy the IDs** to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_REQUEST_ACCESS_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678
   DISCORD_VERIFIED_ROLE_ID=987654321098765432
   ```

2. **Restart the bot** to load the new configuration

### 3. Bot Permissions Required
The bot needs these permissions:
- **Manage Roles** - To assign the verified role
- **Send Messages** - To send notifications
- **Use Slash Commands** - For the `/request-access` command
- **Read Message History** - To see context
- **Embed Links** - For rich message formatting

## Usage

### For Users
- **Command**: `/request-access`
- **Where**: Only works in the configured request channel
- **When**: When users want access to private channels
- **Process**: Fill out modal form with Name and Email
- **Result**: Automatic verified role assignment upon submission

## Features

### Security & Validation
- ✅ **Channel restriction** - Command only works in designated channel
- ✅ **Role checking** - Prevents duplicate requests from verified users
- ✅ **Form validation** - Validates name and email format requirements
- ✅ **Spam prevention** - Prevents multiple pending requests per user
- ✅ **Auto cleanup** - Removes old pending requests (24 hours)
- ✅ **Data validation** - Enforces minimum/maximum length requirements

### User Experience
- ✅ **Clear messaging** - Intuitive embeds with step-by-step guidance
- ✅ **Real-time feedback** - Immediate responses to actions
- ✅ **Instant confirmation** - Users get immediate access notification
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful error messages for edge cases
- ✅ **Modal forms** - Clean, Discord-native form interface
- ✅ **Automatic role assignment** - No waiting for manual approval

### Multi-Client Support
- ✅ **Environment-based config** - Perfect for per-client deployments
- ✅ **No database dependency** - Uses Discord's built-in role system
- ✅ **Scalable architecture** - Easily deployed to multiple Discord servers

## Technical Implementation

### Components Added
1. **RequestAccessCommand** (`/src/commands/RequestAccessCommand.js`)
   - Handles the `/request-access` slash command
   - Validates channel and role permissions
   - Creates the request interface with "Complete Access Form" button

2. **RequestAccessHandler** (`/src/handlers/RequestAccessHandler.js`)
   - Manages the full request workflow with modal forms
   - Creates and handles modal submissions (Name & Email fields)
   - Automatically assigns verified roles upon form completion
   - Validates form data (name length, email format)
   - Supports future field extensions through configurable field system

3. **Updated InteractionHandler** (`/src/core/InteractionHandler.js`)
   - Routes new button interactions and modal submissions
   - Integrates with existing interaction system
   - Handles `access_request_modal_` submissions

4. **Updated SlashCommandManager** (`/src/core/SlashCommandManager.js`)
   - Registers the new `/request-access` command

### Environment Integration
The feature integrates with the existing environment variable system:
```javascript
discord_server: {
  defaultGuildId: process.env.DISCORD_GUILD_ID,
  defaultChannelId: process.env.DISCORD_JOIN_CAMPAIGNS_CHANNEL_ID,
  requestAccessChannelId: process.env.DISCORD_REQUEST_ACCESS_CHANNEL_ID,
  verifiedRoleId: process.env.DISCORD_VERIFIED_ROLE_ID
}
```

## Deployment Considerations

### For Multi-Client Deployments
Each client deployment should have their own:
- ✅ **Unique channel ID** for their request channel
- ✅ **Unique role ID** for their verified role
- ✅ **Separate environment file** with client-specific values
- ✅ **Independent bot instances** (recommended)

### Best Practices
1. **Test thoroughly** before deploying to production
2. **Set up proper permissions** for the bot in each server
3. **Monitor logs** for any permission issues
4. **Document the process** for each client
5. **Train moderators** on the approval process

## Error Handling

The system handles various edge cases:
- **Channel not found** - Clear error message
- **Role not found** - Logged error with details
- **Permission denied** - Informative user feedback
- **User not in server** - Graceful handling
- **DM disabled** - Fallback to channel notifications

## Analytics & Tracking

All request-access interactions are tracked through the existing analytics system:
- **Command usage** (`slash_command_request_access`)
- **Modal display** (`access_request_modal_display`)
- **Successful completions** (`access_request_completed`)
- **Role assignments** (logged with user info and form data)

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Monitor logs** for permission issues
- **Check pending requests** don't accumulate
- **Verify role assignments** work correctly
- **Update documentation** as needed

### Troubleshooting
1. **Command not working** → Check bot permissions
2. **Role not assigned** → Verify role ID and bot role hierarchy
3. **Modal not appearing** → Check Discord client version and permissions
4. **Wrong channel error** → Verify DISCORD_REQUEST_ACCESS_CHANNEL_ID
5. **Form validation errors** → Check name length (2-50 chars) and email format

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Additional form fields** (phone, company, etc.) - easily configurable
- **Custom field validation** rules per server
- **Multiple verification levels** with different roles
- **Conditional role assignment** based on form responses
- **Data export** capabilities for user information
- **Admin dashboard** integration for user management
- **Welcome message customization** per server
