# Disabled Referral Link User Experience

**Date**: January 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & IMPROVED**

## 🎯 **The User Experience Problem**

When a campaign is paused, archived, or deleted, the associated referral links become disabled. Previously, users clicking on these links would see generic, unhelpful error messages that provided no context or branding.

---

## 🔴 **BEFORE: Poor User Experience**

### **What Users Saw Previously**

When clicking a disabled referral link (`https://yoursite.com/r/adidas-new-xtbvvo`):

```
❌ Error 404: Referral link not found
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ **Generic Error**: No context about WHY the link is disabled
- ❌ **No Branding**: Lost all campaign and client branding  
- ❌ **Confusing**: Users don't know if it's permanent or temporary
- ❌ **Poor UX**: Looks like a broken link or technical error
- ❌ **No Information**: No way to understand what happened

---

## 🟢 **AFTER: Excellent User Experience**

### **What Users See Now**

When clicking a disabled referral link, users see a **beautifully designed, branded page** that explains exactly what's happening.
