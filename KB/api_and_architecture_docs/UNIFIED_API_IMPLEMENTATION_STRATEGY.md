# Unified Business Logic API Implementation Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for implementing the unified business logic API architecture within the existing Virion Labs mono-repo. We will transform the existing `/packages/api/` package by directly migrating from Supabase to Strapi and enhancing it into a sophisticated business logic orchestration layer.

**Key Context:**
- Strapi is already fully implemented and running at localhost:1337
- Dashboard and Discord bot connect directly to Supabase (not through API package)
- Only the MCP server currently uses the API package
- This allows for direct Strapi migration without disrupting other services

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing API Package Strengths
- **Architecture**: Well-structured FastAPI application with proper separation of concerns
- **Coverage**: 15 router modules covering all major business domains
- **Limited Integration Impact**: Only MCP server currently uses this API package
- **Authentication**: Robust dual-auth system (JWT + API keys)
- **Patterns**: Following FastAPI best practices with service layers

### Current Limitations
- **Data Layer Coupling**: Direct Supabase queries throughout service methods
- **Limited Domain Logic**: Business rules scattered across services
- **No Workflow Management**: Complex multi-step processes handled ad-hoc
- **Outdated Database**: Using Supabase while Strapi is available and preferred

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Philosophy: **Direct Strapi Migration with Business Logic Enhancement**

Since Strapi is already implemented and only the MCP server uses the current API package, we can migrate directly to Strapi while enhancing the business logic architecture. This eliminates the need for gradual migration strategies.

### Simplified Two-Phase Approach

#### **Phase 1: Direct Strapi Migration with Business Logic Enhancement**
**Objective**: Replace Supabase with Strapi while extracting and organizing business logic

**Current Pattern:**
```python
# In campaign_service.py
async def create_campaign(self, user_id: UUID, data: CampaignCreate):
    # Mixed: validation + business logic + database access
    if not self._validate_campaign_data(data):
        raise HTTPException(400, "Invalid campaign data")
    
    campaign_dict = data.model_dump()
    campaign_dict["client_id"] = user_id
    
    response = await self.strapi.post("/api/campaigns", campaign_dict)
    return self._process_response(response)
```

**Enhanced Pattern:**
```python
# New domain layer
class CampaignDomain:
    def create_campaign(self, data: CampaignCreate, client_id: UUID) -> CampaignBusinessModel:
        # Pure business logic - no database access
        validated_campaign = self._apply_business_rules(data)
        enriched_campaign = self._enrich_campaign_data(validated_campaign, client_id)
        return self._create_campaign_model(enriched_campaign)

# Enhanced service layer
async def create_campaign(self, user_id: UUID, data: CampaignCreate):
    # Service orchestrates domain logic + data access
    domain = CampaignDomain()
    business_campaign = domain.create_campaign(data, user_id)
    
    # Data access through Strapi client
    saved_campaign = await self.strapi_client.save_campaign(business_campaign)
    
    # Business workflow triggers
    await self._trigger_campaign_creation_workflow(saved_campaign)
    
    return saved_campaign
```

#### **Phase 2: Advanced Business Logic & Workflow Implementation**
**Objective**: Implement sophisticated business workflow management and domain logic

**Strapi Client Integration:**
```python
# Direct Strapi integration
class StrapiClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, api_token: str):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_token = api_token
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
    
    async def post(self, endpoint: str, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Handle Strapi API calls with authentication
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_token}"}
        async with self.session.post(f"{self.base_url}{endpoint}", 
                                   json=data, headers=headers) as response:
            return await response.json()
    
    async def get(self, endpoint: str, params: dict = None) -> dict:
        # Handle Strapi API calls with query parameters
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_token}"}
        async with self.session.get(f"{self.base_url}{endpoint}", 
                                  params=params, headers=headers) as response:
            return await response.json()
```

#### **Advanced Workflow Engine Implementation**
**Objective**: Implement sophisticated business workflow management

**Workflow Architecture:**
```python
class BusinessWorkflow:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.steps = []
        self.context = {}
    
    def add_step(self, step: WorkflowStep) -> 'BusinessWorkflow':
        self.steps.append(step)
        return self
    
    async def execute(self, context: dict) -> WorkflowResult:
        # Execute workflow steps with error handling and rollback

# Example: Campaign Creation Workflow
class CampaignCreationWorkflow(BusinessWorkflow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("campaign_creation")
        self.add_step(ValidateCampaignDataStep())
        self.add_step(CreateCampaignStep())
        self.add_step(SetupDiscordBotStep())
        self.add_step(NotifyInfluencersStep())
        self.add_step(CreateAnalyticsTrackingStep())
```

async def complete_campaign_creation(data: CampaignCreationWorkflow):
    # Multi-step business process
    domain = CampaignDomain()
    workflow = CampaignCreationWorkflow()
    result = await workflow.execute(data)
    return result

@router.post("/api/v1/operations/campaign/deploy")
async def deploy_campaign(campaign_id: UUID, config: DeploymentConfig):
    # Complex business operation
    deployment = CampaignDeploymentOperation()
    result = await deployment.execute(campaign_id, config)
    return result
```

#### 2.2 Implement Strapi Data Layer
- Direct Strapi API integration throughout services

### **Integration & Optimization (Weeks 5-6)**

#### Advanced Workflow Infrastructure
```python
class WorkflowEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workflows = {}
        self.step_registry = StepRegistry()
    
    async def execute_workflow(self, workflow_name: str, context: dict) -> WorkflowResult:
        workflow = self.workflows[workflow_name]
        return await workflow.execute(context)

class WorkflowStep(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, context: dict) -> StepResult:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def rollback(self, context: dict) -> None:
        pass
```

#### Business Workflow Implementations

## API Endpoint Transformation Strategy

### Current Structure → Business Logic Structure

#### **Before (Current Mixed Pattern):**
```
GET  /campaigns/                    # List campaigns
POST /campaigns/                    # Create campaign
GET  /campaigns/{id}                # Get campaign
PUT  /campaigns/{id}                # Update campaign
```

#### **After (Business Logic Focused):**
```
# Workflows - Multi-step business processes
POST /api/v1/workflows/campaign-creation/start        # Start campaign creation workflow
POST /api/v1/workflows/campaign-creation/complete     # Complete campaign setup
POST /api/v1/workflows/onboarding/initiate           # Start user onboarding
POST /api/v1/workflows/referral-processing/generate   # Generate referral links

# Operations - Complex business operations
POST /api/v1/operations/campaign/deploy               # Deploy campaign with bot setup
GET  /api/v1/operations/analytics/generate-report     # Generate business reports
POST /api/v1/operations/referral/calculate-roi        # Calculate referral ROI

# Integrations - External system coordination
POST /api/v1/integrations/discord/server-setup       # Discord bot deployment
POST /api/v1/integrations/strapi/sync-permissions     # Sync user permissions
POST /api/v1/integrations/analytics/track-event       # Track business events
```

### MCP Server Integration Strategy
