## 4. For Clients/Brands

As a Client or Brand, the dashboard empowers you to create, manage, and monitor your marketing campaigns, especially those integrated with Discord bots.

### Getting Started: Your First Campaign

For new clients, your journey begins with an onboarding process that guides you through creating your first campaign. This is a simple 4-step wizard.

**Step 1: Business & Campaign Info**
*   Provide basic information about your business, such as company name, industry, and website.
*   Define the initial details of your campaign, including its name, the template to use, a description, and the start/end dates.

**Step 2: Bot Branding**
*   Customize the Discord bot that will interact with users in your campaign.
*   You can set the bot's name, brand color, logo, and even its personality (e.g., friendly, professional) and response style.
*   You will also write a welcome message that the bot will use.

**Step 3: Discord Server Sync**
*   Connect your Discord server to the dashboard. This allows the platform to see your server's channels and roles, which is necessary for campaign configuration.

**Step 4: Campaign Configuration**
*   Select the specific Discord server and channel where the campaign will run.
*   Configure the campaign's behavior, such as automatically assigning roles to users, enabling moderation, and setting interaction limits.

Once you complete all four steps, click **"Create Campaign"**. Your campaign will be created as a draft, and you will be taken to your campaign dashboard.

### Managing Your Campaigns

After creating your first campaign, you will manage all your campaigns from the main campaign dashboard. This dashboard provides a comprehensive table of your campaigns with the following information:

*   **Campaign**: The name of the campaign.
*   **Discord Server**: The ID of the server where the campaign is active.
*   **Template & Type**: The template and type of the campaign.
*   **Status**: The current status (e.g., Active, Paused, Archived, Inactive).
*   **Metrics**: Key performance indicators, including total interactions, successful onboardings, and referral conversions.
*   **Dates**: When the campaign was last updated and created.

#### Creating Additional Campaigns

To create more campaigns after your first one, look for a **"Create Campaign"** button on your dashboard. This will launch a campaign wizard similar to the one in your initial onboarding.

#### Actions for Each Campaign

From the actions menu for each campaign in the table, you can:

*   **Preview Landing Page**: See what the user-facing landing page for the campaign looks like.
*   **Edit Campaign**: Modify the settings of your campaign.
*   **Pause/Resume/Activate**: Control the live status of your campaign. A paused campaign will temporarily stop interactions.
*   **Archive**: Mark a campaign as completed. This is for campaigns that are finished but you want to keep their data.
*   **Delete**: Move a campaign to the trash. Deleted campaigns can be restored or permanently deleted later.

#### Analytics and Reporting

Navigate to the "Analytics" section of the dashboard to get a deeper insight into your campaign performance, return on investment (ROI), and influencer contributions.
