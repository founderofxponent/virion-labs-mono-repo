- **Public Campaigns**: Mixed organic + referral tracking
- **Clear Segmentation**: Separate metrics by campaign type

## 🔧 Configuration Examples

### Nike Zoom - Private Channel Campaign
```javascript
{
  campaign_name: "Nike Zoom Exclusive",
  private_channel_id: "1234567890123456789",
  access_control_enabled: true,
  referral_only_access: true,
  auto_role_on_join: "nike-zoom-member",
  onboarding_channel_type: "private"
}
```

### Fashion Community - Open Campaign  
```javascript
{
  campaign_name: "Fashion Community Support",
  access_control_enabled: false,
  referral_only_access: false,
  onboarding_channel_type: "any"
}
```

## How It Works

### Publishing Flow
1. **Dashboard Trigger**: Admin clicks "Publish to Discord" button
2. **API Processing**: System fetches all campaigns per guild
3. **Discord Bot**: Receives publish request via webhook
4. **Channel Update**: Bot creates/updates message in `join-campaigns` channel
5. **User Interaction**: Users click campaign buttons to start onboarding
6. **Role Assignment**: Successful onboarding assigns configured roles

### Message Format
```
🎯 Join Active Campaigns

Active Campaigns (2):
Select a campaign to join:

[🚀 Gaming Community] [🚀 Tech Beta Program]

Inactive Campaigns (1):
⏸️ Marketing Campaign (paused)
```

### Channel Permissions
- **@everyone**: Can view and read history, cannot send messages
- **Moderators/Admins**: Can send messages (for bot commands)
- **Bot**: Full permissions for message management

## Technical Details

### Bot Features
- **Smart Message Management**: Updates existing messages instead of creating new ones
- **Button Limits**: Handles Discord's 25 component limit
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if publish fails
- **Permission Validation**: Only admins can trigger manual publishes

### Database Schema
```sql
campaign_publish_logs:
- guild_id (TEXT) - Discord server ID
- channel_id (TEXT) - Target channel
- active_campaigns_count (INTEGER)
- inactive_campaigns_count (INTEGER) 
- published_at (TIMESTAMP)
- message_id (TEXT) - Discord message ID
- success (BOOLEAN)
```

### API Security
- **Authentication**: Requires valid session/API key
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam publishing
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking
- **Fallback Handling**: Multiple failure recovery paths

# Latest Update: Automatic Discord Publishing (January 2025)

## 🚀 Automatic Publishing to Read-Only Channels

### Problem Solved
**Issue**: The previous system required users to type trigger words like "!campaigns" to see available campaigns, which doesn't work in read-only channels.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic campaign publishing using Channel ID targeting and HTTP webhooks, eliminating the need for user trigger words.

### Key Improvements

#### ✅ Instant Publishing
- **No trigger words required** - perfect for read-only channels
- **Immediate publishing** when "Publish to Discord" button is clicked
- **Channel ID targeting** for precise message placement
- **Smart message updates** instead of creating duplicates

#### ✅ HTTP Server Integration
- **Added Express HTTP server** to Discord bot (port 3001)
- **Direct webhook endpoint**: `/api/publish-campaigns`
- **Real-time communication** between dashboard and bot
- **Proper error handling** and status reporting

#### ✅ Enhanced User Experience
- **Read-only channel compatible** - users can't interfere with campaign messages
- **Professional embed format** with campaign buttons
- **Automatic role assignment** after successful onboarding
- **Visual status indicators** for inactive campaigns

### Technical Implementation

#### New Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "express": "^4.19.0",
  "cors": "^2.8.5"
}
```

#### HTTP Server Setup (Discord Bot)
```javascript
// NEW: Express server for webhook handling
const app = express();
app.post('/api/publish-campaigns', async (req, res) => {
  const { guild_id, channel_id } = req.body;
  const targetGuildId = guild_id || DEFAULT_GUILD_ID;
  const targetChannelId = channel_id || DEFAULT_JOIN_CAMPAIGNS_CHANNEL_ID;
  
  // Automatically trigger publishCampaignsToChannel()
  const success = await publishCampaignsToChannel(targetGuildId, targetChannelId, true);
  res.json({ success, guild_id: targetGuildId, channel_id: targetChannelId });
});
```

#### Enhanced Webhook Handler (Dashboard)
```javascript
// Updated webhook with direct bot communication
const botResponse = await fetch(`${discordBotInternalUrl}/api/publish-campaigns`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ guild_id, channel_id, campaigns }),
  timeout: 10000
});
```

#### Channel Targeting Logic
```javascript
// Prioritizes Channel ID over channel name for precision
if (/^\d+$/.test(channelIdentifier)) {
  channel = guild.channels.cache.get(channelIdentifier); // Direct ID lookup
} else {
  channel = guild.channels.cache.find(ch => ch.name === channelIdentifier); // Name fallback
}
```

### Configuration Updates

#### Environment Variables
```env
# Discord Bot
BOT_HTTP_PORT=3001
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=905448362944393218
DISCORD_JOIN_CAMPAIGNS_CHANNEL_ID=1385186047079616513

# Dashboard
DISCORD_BOT_INTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

#### Channel Permissions (Read-Only Setup)
```
@everyone role permissions:
✅ View Channel: Allow
✅ Read Message History: Allow
❌ Send Messages: Deny
❌ Add Reactions: Deny

Bot permissions:
✅ View Channel: Allow
✅ Send Messages: Allow
✅ Embed Links: Allow
✅ Manage Messages: Allow
```

This enhancement transforms the Discord integration from a command-based system to a seamless, automatic publishing platform that works perfectly with read-only channels and provides an optimal user experience.
